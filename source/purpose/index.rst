Outline
*******

Core systems, which form the foundations of all societies, are broken. We cannot mend them by just being one-dimensional in our approach.

We present a blockchain-based worldwide platform for urban self-reliance named Aliyda.

Truly empowering the communities not just act like the tools for the rich, getting richer.

If one looks closer, there is no place for the poor in the blockchain ecosystem other than being a consumer. He doesn't have the funds to mine, or to buy bitcoins, or to participate in ICO or security tokens.
The financial benefits are definitely skewed and are not geared towards the people who are at the bottom of the pyramid. We are in no way questioning the benefits of technology or its applications.

We take a rather opinionated approach to the creation of an economy where real-world progress can be accounted for by the growth of the system.


If one can visualize the relationship between empowerment through self-reliance, it's easy to achieve the transcendental goals of mankind.

It can only be achieved if we can connect the dots.
Dots that join, domains like Renewable MIcrogrids with distributed Datacenters that offer services like Render Farms/CDN at the same time act as the hub for  Sustainable Microgreens & Mushrooms farming.

There will be 2 kinds of tokens operating on multiple chains, primarily derived from Hyperledger (fabric & Indy) and Polkadot.

First, we would offer time-locked security tokens for initial seed funding for each site. While these sites grow in number, which they intend to, as every city would want to become self-reliant, Aliyda would become a universal platform acting as a new melting pot for people who want to fund as individuals or collective (maybe a DAO), and people or communities which want to grow. Second, we offer utility tokens to consumers of these services.
