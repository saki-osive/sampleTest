    Bringing the top of the pyramid knowledge to bottom of the pyramid students

Luckily, Joy has been part of a grass-root level initiative “Osive” which strives to achieve the goal of: “Bringing the top of the pyramid knowledge to bottom of the pyramid students”. This helped her evolve from a nobody to a person of value who could conduct technical knowledge imparting sessions at many Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges.

Made grass-root level efforts along with my peers to formulate: “Talent Enrichment Pipeline". Vision is to filter raw talent, enrich the students with core technical knowledge, and refine them to diamonds.
