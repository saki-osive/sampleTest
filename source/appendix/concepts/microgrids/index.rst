**What is a microgrid?**

A microgrid is a local, interconnected energy system within clearly defined electrical boundaries that :

- incorporates loads and decentralized energy resources, including storage,
- multiple energy sources or electrical-only,
- grid-connected or off-grid mode,
- a single entity with its own independent control in both modes,
- power range from several kW to multiple MW, voltage range up to MV.

In the early 20th century, the centralization of electricity production made huge progress, enabling significant economies of scale and improved power plant efficiency. The 21th century is encountering new challenges that decentralized solutions such as microgrids could help to tackle.
Microgrids enable an optimized way to access reliable, green, and resilient energy through a local, interconnected energy system within clearly defined electrical boundaries, which incorporate loads, decentralized energy resources, battery storage, and control capabilities.

   Achieve energy resilience, reduce energy costs and maximize assets lifetime

A microgrid brings in self-sustainable system, consisting of interconnected distributed energy resources and loads undera common control scheme that can operate in an independent mode during grid failures.Energy resources may be renewables like solar and wind, diesel generators, gas turbines, battery storage, electric vehicles and/or demand/response.Microgrids may serve applications ranging from industrial and commercial, campus/institutional, communities to military installations, in an autonomous or grid-connected manner.


Energy decentralization is a major development that could help tackle the energy challenges of the 21st century. Major technical and economic changes continue to occur. There is substantial progress regarding decentralized energy resources, such as solar energy and battery storage. IoT is also operationalâ€“driving new cooperation and optimization capabilities. Microgrids are one answer to this energy transition situation and their benefits encompass energy reliability, energy accessibility, independence through renewable generation, and energy cost optimization.
